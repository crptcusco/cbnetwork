Actually work
- Optimized Mount attractor field's method
- Detailed Network Graph
- Coupled Boolean Network Dynamics Checker
- Analise the attractors that are part of attractor fields.
- Why the memory full


Future Work
- Adapt the method with parallelism and distributed
 computing to use HPC.

- With the information of topology, local functions can be
Estimates:
    - Estimate the number of attractor fields
    - Infer network stability

- GAN, GAT Graphy attention networks

- Explore other experiments:
    - Use attractors with more quantity of states.

- Explore other forms of solutions:
    - Heuristic Approach to find attractor fields :
    can be (cut method, Degenerated samples...)
    because is a factorial method (Exponential Method)
    - Compute the fields with bases and bases

- Explore other kind of networks:
    - Probabilistic Boolean Networks
